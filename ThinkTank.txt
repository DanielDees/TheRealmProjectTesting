minimap render tiles should have x/y position so they can be rendered relative to the player instead of jumping tile to tile. Fix overflow issue by measuring total tile widths and dividing it's width by the x/y overflow value onto the map by distance from the player being > minimap max distance. 

minimap X/Y, width, height

playerX/Y = minimap center.
tiles x/y = actual tile positions only load if within renderrange
if tile x/y is within renderrange but < minimap X/Y but finishes rendering > minimap X/Y
then divide width by amount overflowing off minimap and render.

player rendered on top of that.
player should be triangle pointing up.




//Change the screenType variable to switch-case object. Pseudo-code ahead.
/*

var screenType = {
  
  location: MAIN_MENU,

  render: function() {
  
    switch:

      case MAIN_MENU:
        drawMainMenu();
        break;

      case BOSS_SCREEN:
        drawBossScreen();
        break;

      etc...
  }
}

Another possibility is to have a list of screen types
and just render whichever ones are true

var screenType = {
  
  MAIN_MENU:    true,
  GAME_MAP:     false,
  BOSS_ROOM:    false,
  OPTIONS:      false,
  INSTRUCTIONS: false,
  CHAR_SELECT:  false,
}
