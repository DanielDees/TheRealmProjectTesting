Bugs to Fix: 

1: When Moving an item from the player inventory to a loot bag, 
the swap function seems to work fine when moving an item to an empty slot, 
but when moving an item to swap with another item in the lootbag from the player inventory, 
the player's inventory item just overwrites the lootbag item instead of switching.
